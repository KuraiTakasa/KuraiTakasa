## Hi there 👋
I am a student at Murdoch University exploring the field of Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. I am a sucker for knowledge and am looking to learn and improve my skills in all aspects of the digital world. 

I heard that GitHub is a specially designed tool that will help me arrange all my projects here for people around the world to see. Hence, I will update all my repositories to be publicly visible :)

I also love connecting with people, so feel free to contact me if you can find me ;)
Love ya
